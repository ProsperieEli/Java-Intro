Shopping List Game.

# What is the activity?

The Shopping List game is a small, simple activity done using vanilla Java. It is meant to show an understanding of arithmatic values in Java programming such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

The activity is also a way to gain more experience with using the Scanner class previously learned in an earlier lesson. 

# What will the activity produce?

The end result of a successful output is the user giving:
1. A starting budget.
2. an item they will be purchasing.
3. The price of said object. 
4. The quantity of the items. 
5. and finally, outputting how many items the user is purchasing. 

The activity should also use basic arithmatic solutions to increase the price the more an item is added and stopping if the budget limit is reached.
